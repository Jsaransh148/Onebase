Hi, I’m **Saransh Jain**.

I’ve been lifting on and off for over **10 years**. Like many people, my early years were spent training without much structure. Lifting weights, but without truly understanding *why* I was doing what I was doing.

That changed when I came across **StrongLifts 5×5**  
(https://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5/).

For the first time, I was introduced to **compound lifts** and a simple, disciplined approach to training.

- Lift heavy.  
- Train three days a week.  
- Rest on the others.

It worked — and it worked consistently. For raw strength, it remains one of the best and simplest training programs.

## Beyond Just Strength

Post-COVID, I was introduced to **group training classes**, and that experience changed my perspective on fitness.

While strength is essential, day-to-day life demands more than just lifting heavy:

- Mobility  
- Agility  
- Coordination  
- Consistency  

I realised that strength alone isn’t enough for long-term health and movement.

So I evolved my own approach:
- **Heavy compound lifting** a couple of days a week  
- **Strength-focused group classes** on the remaining days  

That balance worked great for both physically and mentally.

## Why Base Exists

BASE is built on this exact philosophy.

We focus on **one group workout type: Strength** — done the right way.  
No random workouts. No unnecessary complexity.

At the same time, we respect that group classes aren’t for everyone.

That’s why we also have a **dedicated compound lift section**.  
You can come in anytime and do your own workout if classes aren’t your thing.


That’s **BASE**.
